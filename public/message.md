Hi all, Ivy (creator and maintainer of Maintained) here!

After 3 years of operation, Maintained and associated services (including identity, database, and Tai badging) are being sunset. This will occur on **December 3rd, 2022.**

Account data will not be preserved.

If you are interested in reading about the development journey, an archive of what it looked like, as well as what I'm working on next, you can do so at [Maintained's project page on Ivy Direct](https://ivy.direct/sunset/maintained). Maintained is still open source and available for you to host yourself, if you desire to use it.
